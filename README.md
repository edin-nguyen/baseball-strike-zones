# Baseball Strike Zones Visualizer
A tool that analyzes a players' pitch data by generating a strike zone chart with their pitches faced with outcomes and positions. Useful for understanding pitch placements, tendencies, and performance.
## How It Works
1. Parses CSV file tracking pitch data for key information:
   - pitch location
   - pitch outcome
2. Uses Matplotlib to generate strike zone plot and plot pitches on graph with descriptions

## Usage
Go to https://edin-nguyen.github.io/baseball-strike-zones/

You can select a batter and their strike zone chart will pop up

Hovering over each plotted pitch will show more information on that pitch

## Future Improvements
Ability to uplaod file and look at pitches from uploaded files
More information shown when hovering over pitch
  - type of pitch
  - pitch count
